      **Description:**
      --
      We need to design and implement the database schema for the project
      management system. This includes:

      - Define all entity tables (Project, Sprint, Issue, etc.)
      - Set up relationships and foreign keys
      - Create indexes for performance
      - Add migration scripts

      **Acceptance Criteria:**
      - [ ] All tables created with proper constraints
      - [ ] Prisma schema file updated
      - [ ] Migration tested on dev environment
    }

      I've reviewed the schema and it looks good. We should add an
      index on the project_id column for better query performance.
